## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Being patient and understanding with new contributors

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances

- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information (doxing) without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
- Deliberate intimidation or threats
- Discrimination based on protected characteristics

## Enforcement

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to:

- Remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct
- Temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at support@jsonindenter.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
